### 10. Documentation issues
#### Status: Closed

##### Pages
- [Closed] Separate documentation and landing page into separate pages. The pages should have separate routes i.e., a landing page at /, documentation at /documentation, a showcase page at /showcase 
- [Closed] Documentation does not include all components. It should include all components in this design system
- [Closed] Apply the same header component across all pages. The header used in the documentation page is ideal
- [Closed] The title should always remain the same across all pages
- [Closed] clicking the title should lead to the landing page at /
- [Closed] the title should always read "Paperkit"
- [Closed] remove the "home" link on the navigation bar since the / link exists on the label "paperkit"
- [Closed] remove max width on documentation page. All pages should be wrapped with the same container component for consistency. The same navigation header component used in the landing page should be used across the three pages and all subsequent pages. Make it a reusable component
- [Closed] There is no consistency in the header and hero layout between the showcase page and the rest of the pages. Do not change the color of the header to gradient colors please. I like it the way it is.
- [Closed] create an about page at /about. The about page should include the inspiration for it i.e., designing low fidelity designs in figma and wantint to continue doing it in React with vibe coding. Mention when it's relevant to use it including when there is no design system in place and you just want to present a UX flow
- [Closed] add space between hero component and the content that follows it in the documentation page
- [Closed] on the navigation bar the button with the link of the active page should be a primary button

##### Lists
- [Closed] list item borders should match those of basic buttons

##### Input
- [Closed] Render props table and components separately for each input component instead of a showcase form
- [Closed] Where there are variants involved, render the components and example usage code for all variants. Also do this for all other components with variants
- [Closed] All input components should be grouped under input including radio buttons and checkboxes

##### Notifications
- [Closed] Show buttons to trigger all notification variants
- [Closed] Notification should not have a background color. Only the icon in the notification should be used to differentiate with a badge component with a background color
- [Closed] The notification variants should use different icons, cross for error, info for info, warning for warning etc.

##### Showcase
- [Closed] Create a showcase page and showcase extensive usage of the design system for forms with one form, a social media feed, user profile, dashboard
- [Closed] Display the showcased usecase in different tabs
- [Closed] display the showcased usecases outside of tabs top to bottom


### 11. Remove interactive examples below documentation
#### Status: Closed

The interactive examples section should not be shown in documentation
