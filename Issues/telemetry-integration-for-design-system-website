# Telemetry Integration for Design System Website

The Protokit design system website consists of four main pages that would benefit from comprehensive telemetry integration: the landing page (App.tsx), About page, Showcase page, and Documentation page. Each page serves distinct purposes and contains various interactive components that would generate valuable user behavior data.

Landing Page Telemetry Coverage: The landing page serves as the primary entry point and showcases the design system's capabilities through interactive component demonstrations. Telemetry should capture user engagement with the extensive component library including buttons, forms, modals, notifications, and interactive elements like sliders, toggles, and date pickers. This page would generate data on initial user impressions, component interaction patterns, and feature discovery rates. The landing page also contains navigation elements and call-to-action buttons that would provide insights into user flow and conversion intent.

About, Showcase, and Documentation Page Telemetry: The About page focuses on brand storytelling and value proposition, while the Showcase page demonstrates real-world applications through dashboard interfaces, social media feeds, user profiles, and comprehensive form examples. The Documentation page provides interactive component examples with live code snippets and prop documentation. Telemetry integration should capture page-specific interactions including form submissions, code copying behavior, component testing interactions, and navigation patterns between different sections. The extensive use of interactive elements like tabs, accordions, pagination, and data tables in these pages would provide rich behavioral data on how users explore and engage with the design system's capabilities.

Comprehensive Activity Tracking: Beyond basic page visits, the telemetry system should capture granular user interactions including mouse movements, hover states, click patterns, scroll behavior, form field interactions, and component state changes. This would include tracking interactions with the 30+ components showcased across all pages, user journey mapping through the design system exploration, and understanding which components generate the most interest or confusion. The telemetry should also monitor performance metrics, user session duration, and conversion funnels from initial landing to component adoption or documentation engagement.


## Telemetry Integration Constraints: Protecting Component Integrity

When integrating telemetry into the Protokit design system website, **do not add telemetry or instrumentation directly within the core component code (i.e., any code within `src/components/`)**. The core library components are shared and imported into consumer projects, including developer local environments. Adding telemetry to these components would send data from developer or private projects—violating privacy, polluting analytics, and creating non-production noise.

**All telemetry must be handled exclusively in the website code**, specifically within the top-level page files (such as `App.tsx`, `About.tsx`, `Showcase.tsx`, and `Documentation.tsx`) or in wrappers/HOCs/hooks composed and used only within the website. Track user interactions with components by:

- Instrumenting events in the page containers that use the components (e.g., button clicks in the showcase page),
- Using telemetry-aware wrapper components in the website codebase,
- Listening to React events at the page level,
- Avoiding any import of telemetry clients, hooks, or code in files within `src/components/`.

**Never modify component code for the sake of telemetry.** Component props and implementation must remain telemetry-agnostic.

This constraint ensures that:

- Developers using Protokit do not leak local usage to telemetry services,
- Analytics includes only real website user behavior,
- Component library remains trustworthy, open, and privacy-conscious.

Telemetry Implementation Guidance for Protokit Website

For analytics and behavioral telemetry on the design system website, use only free third-party services. Do not build or maintain a custom analytics dashboard—rely exclusively on managed external platforms.

Recommended Telemetry Providers:
- Pageviews, navigation tracking: Google Analytics (GA4, free tier)
- User behavior analytics (heatmaps, scrollmaps, session recordings): Hotjar (free plan), Microsoft Clarity, or Smartlook (free plan alternatives)
- Event tracking (button clicks, form submissions, feature usage): Amplitude (free plan) or Mixpanel (free/Community plan)

Implementation constraints:
- Instrumentation code should be placed only in page-level files (e.g., App.tsx, About.tsx, Showcase.tsx, Documentation.tsx) or dedicated telemetry wrappers/hooks within the website code.
- Do not add imports or telemetry hooks/calls inside `src/components/` (the component library).
- Do not self-host analytics/behavior dashboards; only use managed, free/affordable third-party solutions.

Recommendations:
- Use Hotjar, Microsoft Clarity, or similar for heatmaps/session recordings, and validate coverage via their dashboards.
- Use Amplitude or Mixpanel for granular UX event tracking (copy code, navigation, tab switches, form submissions), at the page/wrapper level.
- Instrument scroll depth and engagement via Google Analytics Events.
- Use Google Analytics, Plausible, or equivalent (free tier) exclusively for page visits and navigation tracking.

Never send analytics events from inside design system component library files.

Telemetry Integration Success Metrics for Protokit Website

To consider the telemetry integration complete and successful, all the following criteria must be met:

1. Isolation from Component Library:
   - No telemetry code, instrumentation, or analytics-related imports exist inside `src/components/`
   - All telemetry and analytics are handled in website-specific files (`About.tsx`, `Showcase.tsx`, `Documentation.tsx`, `App.tsx`) or custom wrappers/hooks in the website codebase.

2. Correct Instrumentation of Key Interactions:
   - Pageview events are sent to a managed third-party platform (e.g., GA4, Plausible) for each page (About, Showcase, Documentation, etc.).
   - Button clicks, navigation, CTA interactions, and section/tab switching are tracked on each major page using Amplitude, Mixpanel, or comparable.
   - Form submissions, code-copying actions, component demo/test area usage, and similar engagement are tracked as specific events.
   - User scroll depth or significant scroll milestones (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) are reported to analytics for engagement/attention analysis.

3. Non-invasive Session/Experience Analytics:
   - Heatmaps, session recordings, and behavior analytics are enabled via a provider like Hotjar, Microsoft Clarity, or Smartlook, managed via provider's embed script in the website shell (e.g., `public/index.html` or `App.tsx`).
   - The script snippets are loaded only in production (not in dev or for library consumers).

4. No Telemetry Leakage to Library Users:
   - New library consumers installing or importing the `protokit` component library get zero telemetry or web requests related to analytics—confirmed by reviewing built node_modules/ output and running a new sample app.

5. Provider Dashboards Show Expected Data:
   - Google Analytics (or equivalent) shows accurate real-user navigation, entry/exit pages, and navigation flows between About, Showcase, and Documentation.
   - Amplitude/Mixpanel dashboards reflect expected event counts for key UX interactions (e.g., code copy, demo engagement, navigation, form submits).
   - Hotjar/Clarity/Smartlook dashboards successfully record heatmaps and representative user sessions of the design system website, confirming full coverage.

6. Performance and Security:
   - No excessive performance overhead observed (< 60ms page load impact due to analytics).
   - No personal identifiable information (PII) or sensitive user data are sent to third-party providers.

7. Alignment with Constraints:
   - All providers used are on the free/plausible/community plan and are managed externally (no self-hosted dashboards).
   - Analytics disables itself automatically for preview/development/local environments.

Only when all of the above metrics are confirmed as met should the Protokit website telemetry integration be considered successfully complete.
